# Docs

Welcome to the UCL Artificial Intelligence Society docs site!

Over the course of the year, we'll be posting content and useful information from our [beginner machine learning tutorial series](/docs/tutorials) and [journal club](/docs/journal-club), amongst other things, so stay tuned!

## The Machine Learning Tutorial Series

In the 2023/24 academic year, the UCL Artificial Intelligence Society [Machine Learning Tutorial Series](/docs/tutorials) enters its fourth season. If you are a beginner seeking to learn more about machine learning or just looking to consolidate your knowledge, join us as we cover different topics within the landscape of artificial intelligence. No prior machine learning experience is expected.
