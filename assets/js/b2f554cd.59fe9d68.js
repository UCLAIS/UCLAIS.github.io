The appearance of AI can be traced back to the work of cryptographers during World War II, who used early computing machines to crack military codes. The appearance of AI can be traced back to the work of cryptographers during World War II, who used early computing machines to crack military codes.\\n\\n### The Enigma and the Bombe\\nEvery country involved in World War II had to encode its military communication to protect vital information from enemy forces. The Enigma Machine used by the Germans at that time was an electromechanical device used to encrypt and decrypt messages. Operators would input plaintext messages on the keyboard, and the machine would encipher the message by illuminating a corresponding letter. The encoded message would then be transmitted, typically via radio. The algorithm would constantly change, so each keystroke would result in a new encryption pattern, which made the Enigma especially complex to crack. \\n\\nTo counteract Enigma algorithms, the brilliant minds at Bletchley Park, including now-renowned Alan Turing developed the Bombe. The Bombe was designed to automate the process of testing possible Enigma rotor configurations to deduce the daily settings. It worked by going through millions of rotor settings of the Enigma machine to determine which composition was used to encrypt a message. \\n\\nBut how was this code-breaking machine a predecessor to modern AI?\\n\\n![The Enigma machine](/img/blog/history-of-ai-1.png)\\n\\nBreaking the Enigma cipher involved identifying patterns in ciphertext to deduce the underlying encryption keys. Modern neural networks, particularly in deep learning, excel at recognising patterns in complex datasets. Image and speech recognition, genomics, and medical imaging are all fields where we use trend detection nowadays. \\n\\nAlan Turing\u2019s Bombe is considered to be an early example of a deterministic (predictable) finite automaton (DFA), which is a theoretical model of computation that processes input step by step (ciphertext), transitioning between predefined states (in his case, rotor positions) according to a set of rules.  Bombe\'s operation highlighted the essence of algorithmic problem-solving and showed the potential of automation, by minimising human error and speeding up repetitive tasks, both now the core principles of AI.\\n\\n### The Turing Test\\nThe lessons learnt from Enigma\u2019s cryptanalysis then got Turing thinking about intelligence. His well-known 1950 paper, \u201cComputing Machinery and Intelligence,\u201d posed the provocative question, \u201cCan machines think?\u201d. He proposed the Turing Test, a standard to determine whether the machine intelligence can be distinguished from the human one. The original Turing Test is set out this way:\\n\\n- Three participants, human evaluator, human respondent and a machine.\\n- After some dialogue, the evaluator will have to decide whether they are interacting with a machine or a human. \\n- If the machine succeeds in deceiving the evaluator, it has passed the Turing Test. \\n\\nThe principles of the Turing Test have sparked divergent evaluations over the past decades. Critics today argue that machines might pass the Turing Test by simply mimicking human-like responses without needing to demonstrate any thought or consciousness. So, they say, passing the Turing Test does not mean that these machines have human-like intelligence; rather, it is overly focused on language, and cognition cannot be fully captured by text-based communication. There now exist numerous alternatives such as Coffee Test, Visual Turing Test, The Lovelace Test, The Theory of Mind test, that take many other modalities into account such as visual perception, decision-making or even emotional understanding.\\n\\nAlan Turing and the work of cryptologists during WWII have directed and pioneered the development of modern computing and created out many major ideas, still inspiring works in the Artificial Intelligence field today. However, we are still on a journey to realise how machines evolve. Even current AI models like ChatGPT-4 and Google Bard haven\'t yet advanced to a point where they can consistently pass the Turing test. In fact, nothing in AI today is even close to meeting the true intent of the Turing Test. The pursuit of creating machines that truly emulate human-like intelligence remains an ongoing challenge.\\n\\n### References\\nFerris, J. (2015). Intelligence.

These shapeless entities are sometimes indescribable, even by the engineers who initially wrote them. Then there\u2019s the issues of algorithms that just don\u2019t work for any number of reasons \u2013 the harmful human biases behind erroneous outputs, overfitted algorithms crumbling outside the nursery of a training set, or on the other hand, algorithms that are pushed into service too early.\\n\\nConsider then the possibility that these algorithms don\u2019t just exist on your Instagram feed or the Amazon home page. Consider the possibility that these systems are making real decisions on human lives. Consider a reality where they choose [who passes an exam and who fails](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5f3e125cd3bf7f1b13f65134/6674_Requirements_for_the_calculation_of_results_in_summer_2020_inc._Annex_G.pdf); [who stays and who is deported](https://www.ft.com/content/0206dd56-87b0-11e9-a028-86cea8523dc2); [who is a criminal and who walks free](https://homeofficemedia.blog.gov.uk/2023/10/29/police-use-of-facial-recognition-factsheet/).\\n\\nThat reality is here already. So why not reform it while we still can? We\u2019re still quite far away from the days of sentient robotic overlords. Before we get there though, it would be a good idea to build responsible AIs, rather than reckless, anthropomorphic ones.\\n\\nTake the case of the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) reaching out to the big data consultants Palantir about [using their tech to calculate prisoners\u2019 reoffending risks](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/16/tech-firm-palantir-spoke-with-moj-about-calculating-prisoners-reoffending-risks). Whatever you think of Palantir, or the MoJ for that matter, this marks an auspiciously tech-savvy move from the Civil Service. The British prison system veered dangerously close to a crisis in the summer, and had to take emergency measures, such as [early releases of certain eligible prisoners](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/process-activated-to-manage-prisoner-movements), to ensure it didn\u2019t reach breaking point. This was the result of over a decades\u2019 worth of chronic negligence, and it\u2019s only expected to buy the government another few months without a new strategy.\\n\\nOvercrowding has been an issue for a while \u2013 England and Wales have the [highest imprisonment rate in Western Europe](https://prisonreformtrust.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Winter-2024-factfile.pdf). Also, prisoners here have started spending longer in prison, with a convict serving [an average of 20.9 months in 2023](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1100628/prison-sentence-length-in-england-and-wales-over-time/), up from 15.5 in 2013. Without too much mental maths, you can start to see where the problems pile up. Throw in the fact that two in five adults are reconvicted in less than a year after release, and now retaining this strained system seems almost untenable.\\n\\nWe shouldn\u2019t continue to allow humans to fail to deliver, when we can take this opportunity to build a completely new and improved system. It\u2019s the best time ever to invest time and resources into the effervescent world of AI. The UK government have the chance to go all-in on a project that, pending success, will have tangible benefits for thousands of individuals disadvantaged by a flawed system.\\n\\nI think reform can begin with what was originally discussed \u2013 algorithms that analyse and evaluate prisoners\u2019 reoffending risks but to support human employees with their decision making, instead of full automation. This should reduce the amount of returning convicts for two reasons. \\n\\nOne, that if we produce an improved success rate, i.e. less convicts returning to prison, the problem of overcrowding shrinks immediately. Two, it also allows prisons to identify those who may need more time to readjust to normal life and offer support. Of course, the prison system isn\u2019t currently built for rehabilitation, but that\u2019s another conversation!\\nWe could even take it one step further and use it to identify who would benefit more from alternative sentencing. Prison sentences shorter than 12 months are less effective at preventing reoffending than community orders, according to a 2024 Prison Reform Trust study. Granted, discretion is needed (!) but this is just one example from the breadth of potential created by AI.\\n\\nHowever, we must ensure the same biases pervasive in other government algorithms are eroded first. Responsible AI principles must be used in this system\u2019s building \u2013 stakeholders should understand how it works without it being exploitable, and training sets should be curated to ensure fair representation across class, background, and representation. These systems should also be able to learn from the human decisions made alongside its use, to further tune its decision-making without falling into bias.\\n\\nThe success of technology in failing institutions is the seed for a future powered by it. It\u2019s the seed for a future without decisions made by humans. However, a future without humans is a future without accountability. Let\u2019s hope this future doesn\u2019t arrive too early."},{"id":"nobel-prizes-2024","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/nobel-prizes-2024","source":"@site/blog/2024-10-20-nobel-prizes-2024.md","title":"AI and the Protein Revolution: Reshaping Our Future","description":"\\"These breakthroughs introduce us to a golden era of science and completely rewrite our future.\\"","date":"2024-10-20T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"October 20, 2024","tags":[{"label":"nobel prize","permalink":"/blog/tags/nobel-prize"},{"label":"chemistry","permalink":"/blog/tags/chemistry"}],"readingTime":3.64,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Sofiya Flenova","title":"Content Executive","imageURL":"/img/committee/sofiya_flenova.jpeg","key":"sofiya"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"nobel-prizes-2024","title":"AI and the Protein Revolution: Reshaping Our Future","subtitle":"Reshaping Our Future","authors":["sofiya"],"tags":["nobel prize","chemistry"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Playing Technocrat\'s Advocate","permalink":"/blog/algorithms-in-government"},"nextItem":{"title":"Welcome (or Welcome Back)","permalink":"/blog/reintroductions"}},"content":"*\\"These breakthroughs introduce us to a golden era of science and completely rewrite our future.\\"*\\n\\n**Demis Hassabis**, CEO of DeepMind, junior chess prodigy, former game developer and, of course, UCL alumnus, made headlines last week by joining the ranks of Nobel Laureates in Chemistry. He and his colleague, **John M. Jumper**, senior science researcher at DeepMind, achieved a game-changing breakthrough by pioneering new methods for predicting protein structures with Artificial Intelligence, and were awarded the half the Nobel Prize for their efforts.\u200b\\n\\nAlong with that, **David Baker**, professor of biochemistry and Director of the Institute for Protein Design at the University of Washington has been awarded the other half of the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for computational protein design.\\n\\nThese breakthroughs introduce us to a golden era of science and completely rewrite our future. And here\'s why we must talk about it. \\n\\n### David Baker\\n\\n*\u201cIn nature, proteins are the miniature machines that carry out all the important jobs: we can think, we can move, we can digest food, plants can capture energy from the sunlight and everything that happens in the living organism is due to proteins. We can use proteins to solve problems that evolution did not manage to solve.\u201d* - David Baker.\\n\\nEach protein chain folds into its own characteristic shape and the folding process is very precise. The shape of a folded protein chain is what defines its biological functions. However, there are so many different shapes a protein can adopt, which made the protein problem so difficult and rendered it unsolved for over 50 years. Up until now. \\n\\nThe gigantic increase in computing power since the problem\u2019s discovery now enables us to design tens of thousands of new proteins with new shapes and new functions. There are now over 10<sup>130</sup> different designs we can explore using computation, enormously larger than the total number of proteins that have existed since life on earth began. After creation, we can  extract the proteins, and then determine their functions and whether they are safe. \\n\\nToday we face challenges such as serious ecological threats as well as new diseases evolving, and we do not have millions of years to wait for the discovery of the right proteins. But using computational design tools, we can now build these completely new multi-purpose proteins. \\n\\n### John M. Jumper and Demis Hassabis\\n\\nThe AI system *AlphaFold2* by DeepMind is the first non-experimental method that can predict the complex structure of any known protein in nature, also solving the \\"50-year grand challenge\\", in the words of Hassabis himself. This system can predict the way a protein folds based on the amino acid sequence it consists of, which enables us to create proteins that can perform very specific functions and help us drive humanity\'s development. \\n\\nUntil very recently it could take research biologists a year to get a single answer about a 3D shape of a protein fold; now we have a machine learning algorithm that can do the same in 5-10 minutes. \\n\\n![Alt text](/img/blog/nobel-prize-1.png)\\n\\nThe program consists of three stages: database search and preprocessing, *EvoFormer*, and structure model. \\n\\n**Database search and preprocessing.** A sequence of amino acids is entered, and *AlphaFold* compares it to records from several databases to extract similar sequences from other organisms. It also creates a pair representation of this input sequence, showing pairs of amino acid residues that are close together in 3D space within the target protein. Residue is the part of an amino acid that remains after it forms a peptide chain with other amino acids, and water is removed.\\n\\n***EvoFormer*** is a unique *AlphaFold* neural network that looks for relationships in residue pairs of the input sequence. It also evaluates the relationship within any two residues, which can be thought of as nodes in NNs. These calculations are carried out 48 times before forming a refined model of residue pair representations. \\n\\nFinally, **the Structure Model** is another neural network that takes the previously refined model and performs rotation and translation on it to create a prediction of what its 3D protein structure looks like.\\n\\nThese newly developed proteins can fight cancer, break down plastic waste, and develop vaccines for respiratory diseases among many other uses. This intersection of biology and AI in 2024 can help us uncover the secrets of life, fight diseases, and even address the overwhelming climate challenges of today and the future."},{"id":"reintroductions","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/reintroductions","source":"@site/blog/2024-10-01-reintroductions.md","title":"Welcome (or Welcome Back)","description":"Welcome (or welcome back) to UCL Artificial Intelligence Society\u2019s blog!","date":"2024-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"October 1, 2024","tags":[{"label":"welcome","permalink":"/blog/tags/welcome"},{"label":"introductions","permalink":"/blog/tags/introductions"},{"label":"events","permalink":"/blog/tags/events"},{"label":"miniblog","permalink":"/blog/tags/miniblog"}],"readingTime":1.49,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Anthony Nkyi","title":"Head of Content","imageURL":"/img/committee/anthony_nkyi.jpeg","key":"anthony"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"reintroductions","title":"Welcome (or Welcome Back)","authors":["anthony"],"tags":["welcome","introductions","events","miniblog"]},"prevItem":{"title":"AI and the Protein Revolution: Reshaping Our Future","permalink":"/blog/nobel-prizes-2024"},"nextItem":{"title":"Is AI an existential risk?","permalink":"/blog/ai-safety-debate"}},"content":"## Welcome (or welcome back) to UCL Artificial Intelligence Society\u2019s blog!\\n\\nI\u2019m Anthony, the new Head of Content, and I just can\u2019t wait for everything we\u2019ve got planned for UCL AI Society this year. \\n\\nThe year ahead is looking exciting \u2013 there\u2019s a lot going on.

Many AI experts like Geoffrey Hinton think that AI should be considered just as risky as pandemics or nuclear war, and that we need to slow down, or pause its development. Others, like Melanie Mitchell, believe that the risks are \u201calmost vanishingly small\u201d. The stakes of the question for humanity warrant a serious (and long, in my opinion) conversation about the respective arguments\u2019 merits.\\n\\nAfter this prelude, my wonderful colleagues Ivana and Maja introduced the speakers. We were lucky enough to have [Reuben Adams](https://www.linkedin.com/in/reuben-adams-10031b180/?originalSubdomain=uk) and [Chris Watkins](https://www.cs.rhul.ac.uk/~chrisw/) arguing for the \u201cdoomer\u201d side (as we referred to it, in the WhatsApp group chat). Reuben is a UCL AI PhD student, and host of the wonderful [\u2018Steering AI\u2019 Podcast](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ai-centre/steering-ai-podcast). Chris is a professor at Royal Holloway, and a prominent thinker in the \u2018Reinforcement Learning\u2019 field. For the \u2018risk-skeptical side\u2019 (the \u2018anti-doomer\u2019 side??), was [Jack Stilgoe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jack-stilgoe-2a6187a/?originalSubdomain=uk) and [Kenn Cukier](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenneth-cukier-9ab56335/?originalSubdomain=uk). Jack is a UCL professor, on \u201chome-turf\u201d as he said, lecturing in Science and Technology Studies (STS), and works closely with UK Research and Innovation on the \u201cResponsible AI Program\u201d. Kenn is a Deputy Executive Editor at The Economist magazine, and hosts the weekly tech podcast, \u201cBabbage\u201d . [Tom Ough](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/tomough), a freelance journalist, who\u2019s written various pieces about existential risk, including in Prospect Magazine, was moderating. Ivana encouraged our audience to consider how the lack of demographic diversity on the panel could systematically bias the conversation, which (as you\u2019ll read) came up in discussions.\\n\\nAt face value, the 4 speakers seemed to argue distinctly opposing points of view. I will briefly give my best effort at summarizing their views, in the order in which they spoke. After, I look to set out promising areas of agreement amongst all the panelists.\\n\\n### The debate\\n\\nReuben opened the debate. He argued that the new paradigm of deep-learning presents a distinctly new category of AI risk: we are building ever-more intelligent \u2018black-boxes\u2019, with novel capabilities we cannot predict. Once there is a \u201csecond species of intelligence\u201d that rivals our own, we are completely ignorant about what will follow. Our current tools for controlling AI systems, like \u2018RLHF\u2019, are woefully inadequate even at present, and won\u2019t \u2018scale up\u2019 with increasing AI progress. What follows from all this? \u201cI don\u2019t understand how you can confidently say that this doesn\u2019t end badly.\u201d\\n\\nAfter Reuben, came Jack. He eased his way into his argument with several cool anecdotes. (From Reuben\u2019s speech, the day after Earnest Rutherford denied the feasibility of nuclear energy, in September 1933, Leo Szilard conceived of the nuclear chain reaction. Jack said that the concept came to Szilard by Russell Square Station. Go there if you want to conceive of the next big thing). Anyway. Back to the seriousness. Rogue AI scenarios are implausible and belong in science fiction. Instead, \u201cthe idea of existential risk from AI is a form of displacement activity\u201d, from other more pressing concerns, like the disempowerment of workers or marginalization of minorities. These are the risks that deserve regulators\u2019 attention. A more interesting question, for Jack, is why people are drawn towards believing these risks: perhaps peoples\u2019 positionality, or for some technologists their self-interest. AI is a tool like any other, in that it\u2019s \u201call about power\u201d, so \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t be worrying about what robots will do to humanity, instead we should worry about what some people will do to other people\u201d.\\n\\nAfter Jack, there was Chris. From his perspective, the algorithmic breakthroughs that enabled ChatGPT are pedestrian. His MSc students are already implementing the \u201ctransformer\u201d architecture for their coursework, the major breakthrough behind large language models like ChatGPT. Given that tens of thousands of people and 11 figure sums are being directed towards AI, we have no reason to believe that further breakthroughs won\u2019t occur. Instead, we should expect a future of open-ended cognitive advancement. This unknowable future is \u201cbehind a veil\u201d. While we aren\u2019t necessarily destined for doom, there are plausible \u201cside-roads\u201d that lead towards it, in particular AI-enabled authoritarian regimes.\\n\\nFinally, it was Kenn\u2019s turn. \u201cThis is bleak!\u201d, he started with. Whilst the risks from AI are serious, they won\u2019t scale to an \u2018existential catastrophe\u2019. Existing alignment techniques like RLHF put humans in the loop, and will obstruct any \u2018intelligence explosion\u2019. Humans are unlikely to cede control of political power or nuclear missile systems to AI. Among different possible futures, we can design \u201clove\u201d into AI. In contrast, misuse risks do seem concerning. Kenn was anxious when news broke in 2022 that AI had developed 40,000 toxic chemicals in 6 hours. However, there is nuance here. The threat model of \u2018misuse risks\u2019 from bad actors already exists today. Lethal Autonomous Weapons may make warfare less brutal. So, let\u2019s not be defeatist, and instead focus on \u201cexistential solutions\u201d.\\n\\n### (Dis)agreements!\\n\\nA key disagreement for the participants seemed to be: Reuben and Chris seemed to acknowledge that exact pathways to catastrophe are unknowable \u2013 and would be analogous to bonobos trying to predict how they would be outcompeted by humans. Kenn, and particularly Jack, emphasized this point, and suggested that the \u2018rogue AI story\u2019 parallels science fiction. Reuben/Chris seem to bite the bullet.\\n\\nHowever, amongst these disagreements, there were several areas of agreement, which questions from our moderator, Tom, helped to elucidate:\\n\\n- Proactive oversight/regulation of AI systems today is necessary to guard against present-day harms, like misinformation.\\n- Careful evaluations of AI models is an area of potential common ground between those concerned about \u2018near-term\u2019 and \u2018long-term risks\u2019 from AI.\\n- AI represents a new (potentially transformative) era for humanity\\n- Predicting exactly how the future will unfold is nigh on impossible; speculation about how exactly AI harms might scale to catastrophe or even extinction is very difficult to conceive precisely.\\n- AI is likely to be a \u201cforce-multiplier\u201d and may enable bad actors to do worse things\\n\\nOn these points, and others, I think the speakers realized that their worldviews were closer than they might have expected.\\n\\nI am very grateful to Ivana, Maja, Asmita for helping with the organizing of the event, and to Andrzej and Yadong for helping with the filming."},{"id":"welcome","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/welcome","source":"@site/blog/2023-08-30-welcome.md","title":"Welcome to the UCL AI Society","description":"Hello and welcome to the very first UCL AI Society blogpost of the year!","date":"2023-08-30T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 30, 2023","tags":[{"label":"welcome","permalink":"/blog/tags/welcome"}],"readingTime":3.825,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Martynas Pocius","title":"President","imageURL":"/img/committee/martynas_pocius.jpg","key":"martynas"},{"name":"Jess Tsang","title":"Event Officer","imageURL":"/img/committee/jessica_tsang.JPG","key":"jess"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"welcome","title":"Welcome to the UCL AI Society","authors":["martynas","jess"],"tags":["welcome"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Is AI an existential risk?","permalink":"/blog/ai-safety-debate"}},"content":"## Hello and welcome to the very first UCL AI Society blogpost of the year!\\n\\nMy name is Jessica and I\u2019m so excited to be your Creative Director this year \ud83d\ude04, You\u2019ll be hearing from me every week about **the AI buzz and news on the society**, and **any upcoming events** you should bookmark in your calendar, so be sure to keep your eyes peeled on the society blog to stay updated \ud83d\udcda\ufe0f.\\n\\nWith the introductions out of the way, today\u2019s blog post is for all our new members and getting you up-to-date on what this is all about. First of all, massive congratulations on getting into UCL! That is no small feat, and we\u2019re so glad you were able to join us in not-so-sunny London \ud83c\udf27\ufe0f (it gets better in February, trust). Secondly, congratulations on having excellent taste in societies, and frankly, joining the best one out there. We promise you\u2019re going to have a good time.\\n\\nSince our inception, the UCL AI Society has grown massively, and we\u2019re proud to say that we are one of the most prolific student societies at UCL. We\u2019d like to think it\u2019s because we have something for everyone, even for those who aren\u2019t compsci students or know how to code! Artificial intelligence is something that will affect everyone in the years to come, regardless of who you are, and as a result, we believe our society should be accessible and relevant to all pathways and disciplines. We hope the AI society can be your place to explore your interests, build long-lasting relationships and make memories for life. Some of the social events you can get involved in are our iconic Thursday Pizza Socials \ud83c\udf55 (free pizza for all!), speaker events with world-renowned researchers \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udfeb, tutorials \ud83d\udcbb\ufe0f, cross-university networking events \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83e\udd1d\u200d\ud83e\uddd1, and more.\\n\\nWe also have programs running on a larger scale for those of you who want to improve your own skills, dip into research or begin a start-up. For research, we have the Nexus Labs project \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83d\udcbb, which is an interdisciplinary initiative for students to engage in one of five academic pillars: Neuroscience, NLP, Finance, Machine Vision and Responsible AI \u270f\ufe0f. Within each pillar, teams will have a specialist on board to explore a question with the aim of publishing a research paper at the end of the project.\\n\\nFor those of you wanting to explore the world of entrepreneurship, we have the UCL AI Foundry \ud83d\udcc8, our incubator for budding AI businesses. Upon joining Foundry, you\u2019ll be given guidance, support and advice throughout the project from assigned mentors. At the end, you\u2019ll be given an opportunity to pitch your start-up to a panel of investors who can help your business take off.\\n\\nAnd finally, our biggest event of the year: ClimateHack.AI \ud83c\udf0e\ufe0f, our society hackathon which brings together 25 leading universities to solve some of our climate\u2019s most pressing problems.\\n\\nThis year, ClimateHack.AI is helping to solve the issue of solar nowcasting \u2600\ufe0f, essentially helping us optimise solar panels as solar power is highly variable considering weather conditions. By building better solar photovoltaic nowcasting, we\u2019re able to help derisk the deployment of solar power and encourage its use in energy grids around the world. In the UK alone, this could help us reduce 100,000 tonnes of carbon emissions. Around the world, there would be a reduction of 50 to 100 million tonnes of carbon.\\n\\nFor ClimateHack.AI 2022, we focused on satellite imagery nowcasting \ud83d\udef0\ufe0f and managed to build a model 3.5x more accurate than the one being used by the National Grid Electricity System Operator (NG-ESO). As a result, we know the impact ClimateHack.AI has, and we\u2019ve seen the good it can do. For ClimateHack.AI 2023, we encourage you to participate if this is something that catches your eye! We can\u2019t make a tangible impact without your help, and the hackathon has been some of our previous members\u2019 favourite part of the society, so we guarantee it\u2019ll be a good time. You\u2019ll be able to meet like-minded individuals, expand your network and career opportunities, and have a shot at our prize pool with a grand first prize of \xa315,000 \ud83d\udcb0\ufe0f!\\n\\nUltimately, as you can probably see, UCL AI Society is packed full of different events happening every week, and as your committee, we\u2019re dedicated to making sure this society provides everything possible to help you thrive both personally and professionally \ud83e\udee1. Regardless, we hope we\u2019ll see you in some of these events once the school year starts up, and as always, feel free to reach out with any questions.\\n\\nSee you next week! \ud83d\udc4b\\n\\nJessica"}]}')}}]);
