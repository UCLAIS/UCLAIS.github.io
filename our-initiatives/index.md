# Our Initiatives

Welcome to the UCL Artificial Intelligence Society Initiatives site!

Over the course of the year, we'll be posting content and useful information from our [beginner machine learning tutorial series](/our-initiatives/tutorials) and [journal club](/our-initiatives/journal-club), amongst other things, so stay tuned!

**Subscribe to our [weekly Newsletter 🗞️](https://dashboard.mailerlite.com/forms/364819/102382926138704937/share) to be up to date with our events and initiatives!**

## 💻 The Machine Learning Tutorial Series

In the 2023/24 academic year, the UCL Artificial Intelligence Society [Machine Learning Tutorial Series](/our-initiatives/tutorials) enters its fourth season. If you are a beginner seeking to learn more about machine learning or just looking to consolidate your knowledge, join us as we cover different topics within the landscape of artificial intelligence. No prior machine learning experience is expected.

## 🧬 Nexus Labs

[Nexus Labs](/our-initiatives/nexus-labs) aims to build an ecosystem driving successful student-led research in AI. Three main objectives power the group:

- Enhancing collaborations between students;
- Granting students with an inspiring and well-equipped brainstorming space;
- Providing students with guidance from world-class researchers and PhD students in the field.

## 🚀 AI Foundry

[AI Foundry](/our-initiatives/ai-foundry) is a startup generator/incubator arm of UCL Artificial Intelligence Society. Through a thorough mentoring, series of recurring workshops, and pitching opportunities, we seek to empower students with the potential to become AI startup founders.

## 📚 Journal Club

The UCL Artificial Intelligence Society runs regular [journal club sessions](/our-initiatives/journal-club) at which leading researchers in both academia and industry share the latest developments in the world of artificial intelligence and machine learning.

## 🌍 ClimateHack.AI 2023

[ClimateHack.AI 2023](https://climatehack.ai/) is a second edition of a joint student initiative uniting the AI communities of 25 world-leading UK, US and Canadian universities to launch an ambitious AI competition to help cut carbon emissions in the energy sector by up to 100,000 tonnes a year! We are proud to host ClimateHack.AI 2023 on [DOXA](https://doxaai.com/) - an AI competition platform that originated in our society!

## 🎙️ Reinforcement Talking Podcast

We have our [very own podcast](https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/ucl-ai-society) (_yes!_), where our members hold engaging conversations with academics, engineers and entrepreneurs!
