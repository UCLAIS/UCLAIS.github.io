Foundry is a startup generator/incubator arm of UCL Artificial Intelligence Society. Through a thorough mentoring, series of recurring workshops, and pitching opportunities, we seek to empower students with the potential to become AI startup founders.

## First Edition
Behind every great company is an experienced mentor. During our very first edition, we matched teams with mentors skilled in the relevant domains, providing startup founders with a risk-free sandbox environment to test their products and concepts, receiving almost immediate feedback, allowing fast iterations. Finally, we organised a demo-day at *Microsoft Reactor London*, giving participants a possibility to pitch their ideas in front of investors and AI experts. 

Stay tuned for the second, even more impactful edition! ðŸ”¥
