# ClimateHack.AI Workshop

**Date: 8th December 2023 (Friday 5pm)**

💡 **Climate Hack.AI has been launched!** This workshop is all about helping you get started with this hackathon, providing tips and tricks to improve your model to move up the leaderboard 🙌🏼.

**Motivation**: The **National Grid ESO** currently relies on expensive and carbon-intensive **natural gas generators** to compensate for the variability of **solar PV power production**. By incorporating **satellite imagery** into near-term solar **PV forecasting models**, the ESO can improve the accuracy of these forecasts and **reduce its reliance on natural gas generators**.

We will be going over each stage of the **ML flow** from preprocessing data to choosing and training your models, so that you can develop one for **site-level PV forecasting** over the next four hours that is both accurate and performant. Your contributions could directly help **cut carbon emissions** in Great Britain by up to **100 kilotonnes** per year!! 💡
