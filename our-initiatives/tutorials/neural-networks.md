# 4: Neural Networks

**Date: 15th November 2023**

💡 We will introduce you guys to **Neural Networks (NN)** in our session this week! This is going to be a introduction our tutorials this half term on **Deep Learning**. We'll start with the fundamental building blocks: **neurons**. Delve into the **activation functions** that determine a neuron's output and the critical concept of loss. As we progress, we will show how **forward pass** computes the outputs of our model, and how **backwards propagation** to update parameters iteratively. NN allow us to **process unstructured data** such as images, whilst training to recognise their patterns for applications such as image recognition - but more on that next time! 💡
