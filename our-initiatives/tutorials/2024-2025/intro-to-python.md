# 1: Introduction to Python

**Date: 9th October 2024**

ðŸ’¡ **Python** is a common, **high-level programming language** known for its simplicity - this means that if you are new to coding, this language would be the perfect place to start! It has access to a lot of **libraries and frameworks**, including **NumPy**, **Pandas**, and **TensorFlow**, that are particularly useful for our ML series which we will cover in the following weeks.

You can access our **demonstration notebook** here: ðŸ“˜ [**Tutorial 1 Notebook**](https://github.com/UCLAIS/ml-tutorials-season-5/blob/main/week-1/1_1_introduction_to_python.ipynb)

Here are the **exercises** you can go through: ðŸ“˜ [**Tutorial 1 Exercises**](https://github.com/UCLAIS/ml-tutorials-season-5/blob/main/week-1/1_3_python_exercises_solutions.ipynb)
