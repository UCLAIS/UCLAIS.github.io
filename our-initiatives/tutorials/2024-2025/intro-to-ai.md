# 0: Introduction to AI

**Date: 2nd October 2024**

ðŸ’¡ We're excited to present our **Introduction to Artificial Intelligence** tutorial session! In this session, we'll take you on a journey to understand the different perspectives on AI and its evolution. We will also cover definitions of the key components of AI, including **Machine Learning** (ML) and **Deep Learning** (DL). **Generative AI**, especially models like GPT-3 and updated versions of this, has created significant attention in recent years. These models have demonstrated the ability to **generate human-like text and creative content** across multiple areas, ranging from **text to image and audio synthesis**. We will showcase some of these examples in the session! Please note that though this session is introducing what AI is in general, we will be mainly **focusing our series on ML**. ðŸ’¡
