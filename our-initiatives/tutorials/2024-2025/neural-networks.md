# 5: Neural Networks

**Date: 13th November 2024**

ðŸš€ Exciting news! This week, we're embarking on a thrilling journey into the world of Deep Learning with our first tutorial on Neural Networks (NN)! ðŸ§  We'll kick things off by exploring the basic building blocks of these powerful models: the neurons. ðŸŽ‡ Get ready to unravel the mysteries of activation functions that determine how each neuron responds and the crucial role of loss in guiding our model's learning process. ðŸ“ˆ As we venture further, you'll discover how the forward pass calculates the outputs of our model, and how backwards propagation works to refine the parameters iteratively. ðŸŽ¨ The real beauty of NN lies in their ability to process unstructured data like images, learning to recognize intricate patterns for tasks such as image recognition - but we'll save that excitement for next time! ðŸš€
