# 4: Classification II & Workshops

**Date: 30th of October 2024**

üí° **Classification** helps us to group data into predefined classes. We will recap classification techniques from last week, including **Logistic Regression**, **K-means**, and **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**. We will cover a new technique called **Decision Trees** which uses a tree-like structure to make decisions based on feature attributes. We will introduce 2 practical machine learning challenges: 
1. [üêß Penguin species classification](https://doxaai.com/competition/palmer-penguins)
2. [üè† California housing price prediction](https://doxaai.com/competition/california-housing/overview)


Over the next 3 weeks until 13 Nov, 2024 18:00 we will be running the housing price prediction DOXA challenge


People who manage to get MAE of under 32.6 will be eligible for **AI society shirt** and a pen (up to 2 or 3 shirts available, so first come first serve).

Check out the last part of our presentation discussing methods to get a better MAE (mean absolute error). We will teach you about ensemble methods including **gradient boosting** and **feature scaling** 

You can access our **demonstration notebook** here: üìò [**Tutorial 4 Notebook**](https://github.com/UCLAIS/ml-tutorials-season-5/tree/main/week-4)

The folder contains notebooks for Decision Trees as well as the DOXA Challenges.
