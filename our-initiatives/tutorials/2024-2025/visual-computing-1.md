# 6: Visual Computing I

**Date: 20th November 2024**

🌟 Get ready to dive into the captivating realm of visual computing! 📷 This amazing field encompasses a wide array of techniques designed to process and analyze visual data, such as images and videos. 🎥 We'll explore the art of image representation, where we transform visual content into digital formats, typically using pixels with RGB values. 🖌️ We'll also delve into the world of preprocessing techniques like normalization, resizing, and rotation, which help us create the perfect dataset for training our neural networks. 🧩 Get ready to be amazed by the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) 🎨! These networks use kernels to extract features and uncover the hidden patterns within visual data. 🔍 We'll learn about classic CNN architectures like AlexNet, VGG, and ResNet, and see how they've revolutionized image classification and object detection. 🌍 Buckle up for an unforgettable adventure in the realm of visual computing! 🚀

Make sure to participate in the [**DOXA Challenge**](https://doxaai.com/competition/cifar-10) for this week on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The default solution is already provided, but we recomend you change the architecture and add augmentations. Also have a look at our **demonstration notebook** here: 📘 [**Tutorial 6 Notebook**](https://github.com/UCLAIS/ml-tutorials-season-5/blob/main/week-6/Visual_Computing_1.ipynb)
