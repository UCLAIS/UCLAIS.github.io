# 3: Classification

**Date: 23rd of October 2024**

ðŸ’¡ **Classification** helps us to group data into predefined classes. **Logistic Regression** is a linear model used for binary classification, while **K-means** is an unsupervised clustering algorithm that categorizes data into clusters. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** find an optimal hyperplane to separate data to make decisions based on feature attributes. Come to this session to explore and implement these three well-known classification methods! ðŸ’¡

You can access our **demonstration notebook** here: ðŸ“˜ [**Tutorial 3 Notebook**](https://github.com/UCLAIS/ml-tutorials-season-5/tree/main/week-3)

The folder contains notebooks for Logistic Regression, SVMs and K-Means. The solutions are available in the same folder.

You can access our **slides** here: ðŸ’» [**Tutorial 3 Slides**](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGSEMcVTo0/tg4iuVLCGYIAIrx3lmvzgw/view?utm_content=DAGSEMcVTo0&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=editor)
