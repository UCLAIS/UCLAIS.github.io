# 10: NLP II

**Date: 24th January 2024**

ðŸ’¡ This week we will look into **NLP applications**. Language **recommendation systems** are present in many tools like social media, dating apps, and music streaming. Have you ever noticed your **social media feed** showing content that weirdly aligns with your interests? NLP is the reason behind this awesome feature! **Dating apps** also use it to help you find potential matches and suggest icebreakers. Even your **music streaming service** quietly relies on NLP to understand your preferences. These behind-the-scenes features make our digital experiences feel customized without us even realizing it, quietly enhancing the way we interact with technology every day. ðŸ’¡
