# 6: Visual Computing II

**Date: 29th November 2023**

ðŸ’¡ This week weâ€™ll be expanding on last weeks session so see how we can turn our classifiers in **generative models**! Generative models have recently captured a lot of attention, with models like **DALL-E** generating art of users and **ChatGPT** generating informative responses to many questions. Our focus will be on generative models for **computer vision**, where weâ€™ll explore how to **build a model** that will learn the intrinsic **features of a dataset** and **generate new images**. Weâ€™ll walk you through how to build your own **auto-encoder** and share with you many newer models that have been used in industry and research alike. ðŸ’¡

You can access our **demonstration notebook** here: ðŸ“˜ [**Tutorial 6 Notebook**](https://github.com/UCLAIS/ml-tutorials-season-4/blob/main/week-6/VAE_andAE.ipynb)
