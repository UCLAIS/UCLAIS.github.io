# 3: Classification

**Date: 1st November 2023**

ðŸ’¡ **Classification** helps us to group data into predefined classes. **Logistic Regression** is a linear model used for binary classification, while **K-means** is an unsupervised clustering algorithm that categorizes data into clusters. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** find an optimal hyperplane to separate data, and **Decision Trees** use a tree-like structure to make decisions based on feature attributes. Come to this session to explore and implement these four well-known classification methods! ðŸ’¡

You can access our **demonstration notebook** here: ðŸ“˜ **Tutorial 3 Notebook** (Coming Soon!)

This is the end of the **Classical Machine Learning** section of the series.

Hope you have a great reading week!
