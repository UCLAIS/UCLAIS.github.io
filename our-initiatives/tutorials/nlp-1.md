# 9: NLP I

**Date: 17th January 2024**

**NOTE: We have slightly changed our schedule - the website dates are the most recent updates!! (No session on the 10th Jauary)**

ðŸ’¡ In our first session, we explore **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, a field aiming to understand and leverage language for problem-solving. We take a closer look at what **language** is and its **mathematical representation**, how algorithms are designed to systematically analyze it, and lastly how we can train a model to **recognise syntax and semantics**. In session one we dive into these topics and develop an understanding of how NLP has enabled breakthroughs in many of the tools and services we interact with daily. ðŸ’¡
