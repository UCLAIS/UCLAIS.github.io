# 2: Regression

**Date: 16th October 2024**

ðŸ’¡ **Linear regression** in simple terms is finding the **line of best fit** given a set of data points that loosely follow a linear pattern. One way of doing this is by **minimising the loss** (difference between actual and computed value), making it useful for **predicting numerical outcomes** based on input features. **Polynomial regression** extends linear regression by allowing the model to capture **nonlinear relationships** between variables, using polynomial functions to fit the data more flexibly. ðŸ’¡

You can access our **demonstration notebook** here: ðŸ“˜ [**Tutorial 2 Notebook**](https://github.com/UCLAIS/ml-tutorials-season-5/blob/main/week-2/linear_regression_exercise.ipynb)

The solution is available in the same folder.
