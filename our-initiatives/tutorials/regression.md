# 2: Regression

**Date: 25th October 2023**

ðŸ’¡ **Linear regression** in simple terms is finding the **line of best fit** given a set of data points that loosely follow a linear pattern. One way of doing this is by **minimising the loss** (difference between actual and computed value), making it useful for **predicting numerical outcomes** based on input features. **Polynomial regression** extends linear regression by allowing the model to capture **nonlinear relationships** between variables, using polynomial functions to fit the data more flexibly. ðŸ’¡
