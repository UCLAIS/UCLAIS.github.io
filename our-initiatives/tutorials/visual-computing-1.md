# 5: Visual Computing I

**Date: 22nd November 2023**

ðŸ’¡ **Visual computing** includes various techniques to process and analyse visual data, such as images and videos. **Image representation** involves encoding these into digital formats, commonly using **pixels** with **RGB** values. **Preprocessing techniques** like **normalization, resizing, and rotation** can help us produce a more suitable dataset for training neural networks. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** play a huge role in allowing models to understand images, using **kernels** for feature extraction. We will also explore **classic CNN architectures** like **AlexNet, VGG, and ResNet** for **image classification** and **object detection**, showing how these architectural designs have revolutionized the field of **computer vision**.ðŸ’¡
