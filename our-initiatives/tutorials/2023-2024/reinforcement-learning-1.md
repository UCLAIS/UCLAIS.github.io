# 11: Reinforcement Learning

**Date: 31st January 2024**

ðŸ’¡ This week's focus will be on exploring **Reinforcement Learning** (RL), a domain that enables the creation of **AI agents** capable of learning autonomously. In contrast to supervised learning, where learning occurs through pre-defined correct examples, RL empowers agents to **learn from their own experiences** via a **trial-and-error** approach. We'll begin with an introduction to **bandit algorithms**, which are foundational to online advertising and recommendation systems. Following this, we'll delve into more advanced algorithms like **Q-learning**, which are instrumental in training robots for autonomous operations and navigating self-driving cars. ðŸ’¡
