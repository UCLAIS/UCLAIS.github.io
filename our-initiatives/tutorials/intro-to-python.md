# 1: Introduction to Python

**Date: 18th October 2023**

ðŸ’¡ **Python** is a common, **high-level programming language** known for its simplicity - this means that if you are new to coding, this language would be the perfect place to start! It has access to a lot of **libraries and frameworks**, including **NumPy**, **Pandas**, and **TensorFlow**, that are particularly useful for our ML series. In this session, the Tutorials team is collaborating with the Development team to create a workshop where we can provide direct help with **setting up your environment** and walk you through python exercises we have prepared for you to get started!ðŸ’¡

You can access our **demonstration notebook** here: ðŸ“˜ (Coming soon!)
