# Yves-Alexandre de Montjoye: The search for anonymous data 

**Date: 9th October 2023**

The AI Society Journal Club was honored to host Yves-Alexandre de Montjoye for a captivating discussion revolving around the evolution of data anonymity amidst the modern data deluge, where our actions and movements are logged in real-time. The surge of large-scale behavioral data has not only augmented our understanding of individual and collective behaviors but also sparked grave privacy concerns.

Yves-Alexandre de Montjoye explored the inadequacies of conventional de-identification approaches in preserving privacy in the big data epoch. He navigated through the transformation needed in data anonymization paradigms, advocating for a shift towards the anonymous usage of data. The discourse included a meticulous examination of modern privacy engineering techniques, ranging from Differential Privacy to Query-Based Systems, elucidating their respective advantages and limitations.

Wrapping up the talk, de Montjoye envisioned how the confluence of these cutting-edge techniques can enable the meaningful utilization of large-scale behavioral data while ensuring robust privacy safeguards for individuals. This session offered a profound insight into harmonizing data utility with privacy preservation, and how the integrated application of modern privacy engineering techniques can pave the way for secure and impactful data usage in the burgeoning field of big data.
