# 1: Introduction to Python

**Date: 9th October 2024**

ðŸ’¡ **Python** is a common, **high-level programming language** known for its simplicity - this means that if you are new to coding, this language would be the perfect place to start! It has access to a lot of **libraries and frameworks**, including **NumPy**, **Pandas**, and **TensorFlow**, that are particularly useful for our ML series. In this session, the Tutorials team is collaborating with the Development team to create a workshop where we can provide direct help with **setting up your environment** and **walk you through Python exercises** we have prepared for you to get started! ðŸ’¡

You can access our **demonstration notebook** here: ðŸ“˜ [**Tutorial 1 Notebook**](https://github.com/UCLAIS/ml-tutorials-season-5/blob/main/week-1/1_1_introduction_to_python.ipynb)

Here are the **exercises** you can go through: ðŸ“˜ [**Tutorial 1 Exercises**](https://github.com/UCLAIS/ml-tutorials-season-5/blob/main/week-1/1_2_python_exercises.ipynb)

You can access our **slides** here: ðŸ’» [**Tutorial 1 Slides**](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFmvE-ptx0/lyY0SiOcjgSxrb201KcC8w/edit)

The **recording** from this session is available here: ðŸŽ¤ [**Tutorial 1 Recording**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adnK-hc2DmY)

Here are two videos covering our exercise **solutions**:

- Exercises 1 to 4: [Solution pt1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmHgg0IR680)
- Exercises 5 and 6: [Solution pt2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Kmt0qmibrg)

We will not go through all of the notebooks in the session, but throughout this series, we will be referring back to them.

For more information on various **Python libraries**, we have **extra resources** available here: ðŸ“˜ [**Python Notebook Collection**](https://github.com/UCLAIS/ml-tutorials-season-4/tree/main/week-1)
