AI is possibly one of the biggest talking points in the tech industry right now. We all have our own idea of what AI is, much of which has been shown to us by movies and television. AI is beginning to influence a huge range of industries and has even been used in the development of some of the biggest block buster movies, most recently The Irishman!

While AI could be one of the most important talking points for the future, given the start of a new decade, it’s worth having a look back and appreciating how far the field has come.

## Early days
The term was first officially used in 1956, but the idea had been explored from long before, even if nobody knew it. The idea first came to the public eye with the ‘heartless’ Tin Man from the Wizard of Oz.

Certainly by the 1950s, a whole generation of mathematicians and scientists were exploring the concept, including Alan Turing. After the 1956 Dartmouth Conference (where the name AI was adopted), research became increasingly serious.

Between the 1960s and the 1990s there was a lack of progress and funding into research began to diminish. This led to what was known as many ‘AI winters’.

## Progress at the turn of the millennium
In the late 90s, progress began to ramp up again. In 1997, IBM’s Deep Blue famously defeated the reigning chess champion Garry Kasparov. Since then, advancements have been unparalleled as AI continually shows its potential. Developments in technology has led to exponential development in the field and AI is embedded in many of the online services we use.

MIT cognitive scientist Marvin Minsky stated that “within a generation, the problem of creating ‘artificial intelligence’ will be substantially solved” in his book ‘AI: The Tumultuous Search for Artificial Intelligence’. Below are five massive achievements in AI that mark just how close we are to realising Minsky’s theory:

## 5 major achievements
- **Writing Poetry**

Yes, AI can write poetry. As bizarre as that sounds, it is true. Google’s Deep Mind wanted to make AI communicate very well and not just solve complex problems. Google fed its AI more than 11000 books. They worked with Stanford University and University of Massachusetts to enhance its natural language skills using a technique called as recurrent neural network language model (RNNLM). It essentially builds sentences a single word at a time by analysing get previous words in that sentence.

it was my turn.


- **Developing scientific theory**

With minimal human input, AI systems such as artificial neural networks can plow through mountains of data, highlighting anomalies and detecting patterns that humans could never have spotted.

The latest AI algorithms are probing the evolution of galaxies, calculating quantum wave functions, discovering new chemical compounds and more.


- **Winning $1,766,250 at a 20 day poker competition**

Libratus, an AI created by Carnegie Mellon University, defeated four of the world’s best professional poker players in a 20 day marathon competition known as “Brains vs AI: Upping the Ante” in Pittsburgh, PA. The reason why this is a phenomenal accomplishment is because the AI was able to successfully bluﬀ against humans. This has tremendous applications in various fields. Libratus had a collective $1,766,250 in chips at the end of 120,000 hands.


- **Dominating games such as GO**

Go is a 2500 year old Chinese game. The game has more possible options than there are atoms in the universe. Hence it isn’t like chess, where the AI has to calculate possible moves. Google Deep Mind’s AI software ‘AlphaGo’ played itself millions of times to get good at the game. And it did, it defeated the world champion Lee Sedol. Eventually Lee Sedol retired from playing the game professionally stating that AI can’t be defeated.


- **Playing real time games**
For an AI to play real time games such as Dota2 or Starcraft and not turn-based games such as chess is a milestone for the technology as they must do multiple things simultaneously. They don’t have enough time to think and plan their moves without worrying about what others might do. The AI must hence make split second decisions at the same time as its opponents and with incomplete data. OpenAI, a nonprofit AI research organisation founded by Elon Musk defeated professional Dota2 teams.

Another reason why it is important for an AI to play games is as it is a safe environment to develop and test AI techniques. They’re perfect for developing narrow AI.
